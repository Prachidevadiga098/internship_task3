Use SQL queries to extract and analysis data from a database
This SQL script contains a set of sample queries and database optimizations for an e-commerce system. It demonstrates core SQL concepts and practices, structured into several sections:

ðŸ§¾ Query Sections:
a. Basic SQL Operations
Queries using SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, and GROUP BY

Example: List products priced above 100 and total product sales sorted by quantity sold.

b. Joins
Demonstrates INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, and RIGHT JOIN between customers and orders.

c. Subqueries
Includes examples of using subqueries in WHERE clauses.

Example: Fetch products priced above average and customers with multiple orders.

d. Aggregate Functions
Uses SUM and AVG to calculate total revenue and average product price.

e. Views
Creates a view order_summary for combined order details including customer, product, quantity, and total price.

f. Index Optimization
Adds indexes to improve query performance on commonly joined columns: customer_id, order_id, and product_id.
